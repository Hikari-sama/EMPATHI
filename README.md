EMPATHI â€“ Human-Centered AI Companion
Project Overview

EMPATHI is a web prototype for a hackathon. It shows how human intelligence (HI) can guide Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create messages that are emotionally appropriate and ethical.

AI is good at generating text, but it often lacks understanding of human emotions and context. EMPATHI helps by letting users add their emotional and contextual input to AI-generated messages.
The Problem & Our Solution

The Problem: Standard AI can create messages that are grammatically correct but might be too formal, awkward, or miss the right tone for sensitive situations, like talking to a grieving friend. AI relies on data and logic, not human experience.

Our Solution: EMPATHI is an AI assistant where humans provide input. It takes a message prompt and shows an initial AI draft. Then, the user applies "emotional filters" using sliders and checkboxes (for warmth, formality, poetic style, relationship, and topic seriousness). The AI then adjusts its message based on these human inputs, making the final message more empathetic and suitable.
AI vs. HI: The Core Contrast

This project demonstrates the essential role of Human Intelligence:

    AI's Strength: Efficiently generates text and processes information based on programmed logic.

    HI's Strength: Provides emotional intelligence, ethical judgment, contextual understanding, and empathy that AI cannot generate alone.

    The Collaboration: EMPATHI shows that effective AI is human-guided. Human intuition and moral sense enhance AI's capabilities for meaningful communication.

Key Features

    Message Prompt Input: A text area for the user to enter their message request.

    AI Generated Draft: Displays the initial message created by the AI.

    Human Emotional Filters: A user interface with:

        Sliders to adjust "Warmth," "Formality," and "Poetic Level."

        Checkboxes for contexts like "Close Relationship," "Serious Topic," or "Poetry Lover."

    Human-Guided EMPATHI Draft: Shows the AI's message after it has been refined by the human's emotional inputs.

    Chibi Character Reactions: (Conceptual) A chibi character that visually changes based on the emotional filters.

Design Aesthetic

EMPATHI uses a cute, chill, and calm design, inspired by Korean manhwas. This includes:

    A soft, muted pastel color palette.

    Clean, rounded user interface elements with subtle shadows.

    A conceptual chibi character that is gender-neutral and gently expressive.

    The overall design aims to be inviting and comforting.

Technologies Used

    HTML5: For page structure.

    CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS): For styling and responsiveness.

    JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For application logic and the rule-based AI.

    Mock AI Responses: Pre-written text variations in JavaScript to simulate AI output for the hackathon.

How to Run Locally

    Clone the repository:

    git clone <your-repo-link>
    cd empathi-app

    (Replace <your-repo-link> with your GitHub repository link)

    Open index.html: Open the index.html file in your web browser. No server setup is needed.

Future Enhancements

    Integrate with real Language Model APIs (e.g., Gemini API, OpenAI API).

    Implement a simple Machine Learning model to learn from user filter choices.

    Add more types of emotional and contextual filters.

    Allow users to save emotional profiles.

    Implement dynamic visual reactions for the chibi character.

    Improve mobile responsiveness.
